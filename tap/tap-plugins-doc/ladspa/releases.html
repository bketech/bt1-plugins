</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
0.4.2
</td><td valign="top">
2004-03-03
</td><td>
TAP Deesser's Monitor control didn't work, apparently because
my awesome out-of-range protection applied to that input
didn't let anything but zero get through due to a typo in the
source. Sigh.
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
0.4.1
</td><td valign="top">
2004-03-03
</td><td>
Added TAP Equalizer/BW, which is identical to TAP Equalizer but
provides separate controls to set the bandwidth of each EQ band
filter.<br>
Fixed yet another crashing bug in TAP Reverberator (which appears
to be introduced upon fixing the previous crashing bug).<br>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">
0.4.0
</td><td valign="top">
2004-02-21
</td><td>
Added new plugins TAP Pitch Shifter, TAP Rotary Speaker and TAP
Vibrato.<br>
Fixed crashing bug in TAP Reverberator (the bug appeared with hosts
that
call <code>activate()</code> before <code>connect_port()</code>).<br>
Fixed lock-up bug in TAP DeEsser (the bug appeared when an input
sample had +/- INF value).<br>
Various smaller bugfixes (almost every plugin locked up when control
input values of +/- INF were appiled).<br>

0.3.0
</td><td valign="top">

before this project moved to SourceForge, and the author sees no
point in keeping outdated versions around.

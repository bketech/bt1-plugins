<h1>About the TAP-plugins project</h1>
<p>
This website holds information concerning some audio software usable
on UNIX-like operating systems, particularly GNU/Linux. The project
producing this software started out in January 2004 when the author
took the plunge of using Linux Audio (particularly <a
href="http://ardour.org">Ardour</a>) in his recording
studio. Initially four <a href="http://www.ladspa.org">LADSPA</a>
plugins were written, but the number of available plugins steadily
increased over time. New plugins are still being actively developed.
</p>
<p>
It was in early June 2004 that the author realized he needed a reverb
solution with such flexibility that a LADSPA plugin could never
provide; not because the sound processing was lacking, but user
accessibility to the internal structure and variables of the reverb
algorithm was needed. As a result, <a href="reverbed.html">TAP Reverb
Editor</a> was written as a separate <a
href="http://jackit.sf.net">JACK</a> application.
</p>
<p>
Today the project provides two software packages for download:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>tap-plugins</b>: A set of LADSPA plugins.</li>
<li><b>tap-reverbed</b>: TAP Reverb Editor, a separate JACK app.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please go to the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tap-plugins">SourceForge project
page</a> to download any of these packages.
</p>
<p>
As a supplement, <a href="http://tap-plugins.sf.net">this website</a>
(which acts both as a homepage and as a manual for all TAP-plugins
software) is available for download as a separate package called
<b>tap-plugins-doc</b> (get it from the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tap-plugins"> SourceForge
project page</a>). However, because the online version may be updated
or corrected between releases, you may want to take a look at it if
you feel something is outdated or plain wrong in the latest tarball.
</p>


<br>
<h1>Announcements and Feedback</h1>
<a href="http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/lad/"><img src="lad.gif"
alt="Linux Audio Developers mailing list" border="0"></a>
<p>
Announcements of new versions of any TAP-plugins packages will be sent
to the <a href="http://www.linuxaudiodev.org">Linux Audio
Developers</a> mailing list. Announcements of greater ("milestone")
releases will be CC:-ed to Linux Audio Users and Linux Audio Announce
as well.
</p>
<p>
TAP-plugins is being developed by Tom Szilagyi. You can send him mail
to &lt;tszilagyi at users dot sourceforge dot net&gt;.  (You should
generally receive a reply in 48 hours, if your mail deserves it;
please note that I have a life, I have to sleep sometimes and I live
on the <i>other</i> side of the planet.) If you would like to start
public discussion about TAP-plugins, please send your mail to the
Linux Audio Developers or Linux Audio Users mailing list, depending on
the nature of your mail (I am subscribed to both lists).
</p>
<p>
Please write if you have problems compiling or running any of this
software, or you feel some plugin does something different than it
should. The author is not a professional programmer, and he is no DSP
guru either; so if you find something isn't right then it probably
ain't. So please write -- unreported bugs never get fixed.
</p>
<p>
In one word: any feedback is most appreciated.
</p>
